    <h1>Halfway Through!</h1>

    <p>It has been over 3 full months since my first class in this wild ride of a bootcamp.  As promised, I have had moments of brilliance, and, probably more often, moments where I felt like I would never understand this web development stuff even if I had all of the time in the world! It has been fun, and I can confidently say that I have learned much more than I ever could have by just studying this stuff by myself at home.</p>
    <p>Way back when I was a guitar class T.A. in college, I used to tell the beginning students the above quote by Ziglar. This wasn't meant to discourage them, but to impress upon them the reality that they were probably going to suck at guitar for awhile...their fingers and wrists would hurt, their brains would feel like they were trying to read alphabet soup, and their roommates would probably ask them more than once if they had somewhere else to practice.  But if they kept practicing, especially when they didn't feel like it, they would start to sound and feel like real guitarists.</p>
    <p>I am definitely taking my own advice to heart now. Some days I feel like I can't remember anything I've learned and it's super discouraging, but when I take a step back I can see just how far I've come.  I just built my own node web server for this portfolio...how freaking cool is that?! I didn't even know what that was a week ago! I'm super excited to see what happens when all of these lessons start to come together, but for now I just need to keep working on feeling and being a web developer.</p>

    <p>Welcome to the initial installment of my blog!  I will try to use this space as an accurate recording of my web development victories and fails.  Hopefully, I will be able to look back at these entries and realize just how far I was able to go in six short months.</p>
    <p>As I write this, it is Fall of 2015, and my favorite team, the New York Mets, are down 3-1 in the World Series.  Much like them, I sometimes feel like an underdog in life in general.  On the surface, I probably don't look like a typical web developer, gamer, or classically trained musician, but the cool thing about being an underdog is that you get to surprise the heck out of people pretty often.  I pray that my Mets are able to do that, but more importantly I hope that I can reach the goal that I have set for myself of finishing the Bootcamp and securing a job that I really enjoy.</p>
