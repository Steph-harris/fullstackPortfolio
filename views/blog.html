        <h2>One year down, a Lifetime to go</h2>
        <time datetime="2017-6-3">6/3/2017</time>
        <blockquote>I don't have time for hobbies. At the end of the day, I treat my job as a hobby. It's something I love doing. -- David Beckham</blockquote>
        <p>A lot has changed in the 13 months between these last two blog posts. A week after my bootcamp ended, I accepted a job as a fullstack developer at the company where I interned. Working full-time for a startup is DIFFICULT. I often say it's the most difficult thing I've ever done, and I have a Master's Degree in Music!</p>
        <p>I commute an hour each way to work, and for most of the first 8-10 months it wasn't uncommon for me to spend 10-14 hours in the office working on the company billing system (which I designed, coded, and documented). Needless to say, I did not have any time for hobbies.</p>
        <p>I noticed that I was forgetting the skills that I haven't used in awhile like Node.js and MongoDB, but didn't know how to refresh them while working in a PHP environment.  The answer was simple: get a hobby! Coding! This sounds ridiculous to me even as I write it; why would you want to spend your entire day writing code, then go home and write more code?</p>
        <p> The only explanation I can give is that I really do enjoy coding as a hobby. When I'm at work, I have to code what my boss tells me to. When I'm home, I can do whatever I want, work with whatever tech I want, etc. It allows me to be creative: no deadlines, no stress, just practicing something that gives me a creative outlet, which, as a former musician, is really important for me.</p>
        <p>I don't code as a hobby every night. Sometimes I'm just way too exhausted, but that's ok. When I need it, it's there. But I also don't take for granted the fact that I'm lucky enough to get paid to do something that I enjoy doing even when I'm not compensated.</p>

        <blockquote>Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. -- Winston Churchill</blockquote>
        <p>Tonight's the night! Six months after taking my first bootcamp class I am finally ready to start showing off my projects to employers. I am super excited, but it is bittersweet to have to say goodbye to the people who went on this journey with me. I am so proud of my class, all 49 of them, and I hope that everyone walks out of that classroom tonight with an awesome new job.</p>
        <p>One thing that I've taken to heart these past few weeks is that to be successful we HAVE to keep coding. I've been lucky enough to land an internship, so I've been coding pretty frequently (even though my personal Github doesn't reflect this since I can't push work stuff!). Web development is an ever changing field, and skills deteriorate quickly if you aren't proactively learning. This is one of the reasons that I love tech, but it is also the reason why it is so difficult to stay in tech.</p>
        <p>The bootcamp is now over, but this is just the end of the beginning. Tomorrow I begin a new part of the journey, but I at least know one constant theme: KEEP CODING!</p>

        <blockquote>It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop. -- Confucius</blockquote>
        <p>One month left. That's it. 30 days from now I will be standing in front of potential employers trying to convince them to hire me for a full-time programming job.</p>
        <p>It seems like a million years ago that I stepped into that packed Rutgers classroom and started relearning the basics of HTML. Partly because that was almost 6 months ago and partly because of the dizzying pace at which we've learned new concepts since then: Node, SQL, Express, Handlebars, Passport, MongoDB, and last, but definitely not easiest, AngularJS.</p>
        <p>I can't say that I'm an expert at any of these topics yet, but I am confident that I at least have a solid, basic understanding of each one.  The more that I think about it, the more I am convinced that's the best any of us can really hope for from going to school.  You're never going to learn what you need to know for a job until you are actually doing it, and I am really excited to get started. </p>
        <p>Here's to finishing strong, getting a handle on these last few concepts, and continuing the trek along this awesome new career path.</p>

        <h2>Halfway Through!</h2>
        <time datetime="2016-2-7">2/7/2016</time>
        <blockquote>“Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly--until you can learn to do it well.”
        ― Zig Ziglar
        </blockquote>
        <p>It has been over 3 full months since my first class in this wild ride of a bootcamp.  As promised, I have had moments of brilliance, and, probably more often, moments where I felt like I would never understand this web development stuff even if I had all of the time in the world! It has been fun, and I can confidently say that I have learned much more than I ever could have by just studying this stuff by myself at home.</p>
        <p>Way back when I was a guitar class T.A. in college, I used to tell the beginning students the above quote by Ziglar. This wasn't meant to discourage them, but to impress upon them the reality that they were probably going to suck at guitar for awhile...their fingers and wrists would hurt, their brains would feel like they were trying to read alphabet soup, and their roommates would probably ask them more than once if they had somewhere else to practice.  But if they kept practicing, especially when they didn't feel like it, they would start to sound and feel like real guitarists.</p>
        <p>I am definitely taking my own advice to heart now. Some days I feel like I can't remember anything I've learned and it's super discouraging, but when I take a step back I can see just how far I've come.  I just built my own node web server for this portfolio...how freaking cool is that?! I didn't even know what that was a week ago! I'm super excited to see what happens when all of these lessons start to come together, but for now I just need to keep working on feeling and being a web developer.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the initial installment of my blog!  I will try to use this space as an accurate recording of my web development victories and fails.  Hopefully, I will be able to look back at these entries and realize just how far I was able to go in six short months.</p>
        <p>As I write this, it is Fall of 2015, and my favorite team, the New York Mets, are down 3-1 in the World Series.  Much like them, I sometimes feel like an underdog in life in general.  On the surface, I probably don't look like a typical web developer, gamer, or classically trained musician, but the cool thing about being an underdog is that you get to surprise the heck out of people pretty often.  I pray that my Mets are able to do that, but more importantly I hope that I can reach the goal that I have set for myself of finishing the Bootcamp and securing a job that I really enjoy.</p>
